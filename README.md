Snoopy-base
==================

A boilerplate for smaller websites or webbapplications using PHP.

Built by Simon Eddeland

Usage
-------
The source code includes a sample website showcasing some of the functionality of Snoopy. Only the folder webroot should be accessible using HTTP-requests. Thus, the webroot folder includes all files visible to users of the website. The webroot folder is further structured into cache (used by the img.php-script), css for all css-files, img for images and js for all javascript files. The sample webpage includes the site controllers hello.php and helloAnother.php, which may be removed when making your own website. All other files in this folder should only be edited, not removed.

The other two folders in the root folder are src and theme. src contains all classes used in Snoopy, and theme contains files related to the rendering phase of Snoopy.
